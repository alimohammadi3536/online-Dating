This project aims to predict the success of matchmaking in online dating platforms using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various user attributes, such as age, gender, education level, interests, relationship goals, activity level, and previous relationship success, to determine the likelihood of a successful match.

The project leverages a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to classify whether a particular match will be successful or not. The dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables, and then the model is trained on historical data to make predictions for new user profiles.
